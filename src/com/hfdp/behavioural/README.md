# Behavioural Design Pattern
Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. 
Behavioral patterns are used to avoid hard-coding and dependencies

## Categories
- Object-Behavioral patterns: Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance. Describes how a group of objects collaborate to perform some task that no single object can perform alone.
- Class-Behavioral patterns: Behavioral class patterns uses inheritance rather than inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control.

## Design Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern (CoR): A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
- Command Pattern: The Command pattern is used when there is a need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the request.
- Interpreter Pattern: Interpreter provides way to include language elements in a program. Interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language.
- Iterator Pattern: Iterators are used to access elements of an aggregate (collection) object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- Mediator Pattern: Defines simplified communication between classes.
- Momento Pattern: Capture and restore an object’s internal state.
- Observer Pattern: A way of notifying change to a number of classes.
- State Pattern: Changes an object’s behavior when its state changes.
- Strategy Pattern: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.
- Template Method Pattern: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.
- Visitor Pattern: Defines a new operation to a class without change.
