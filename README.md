# Head First Design Patterns

## Design principles

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact


## Design patterns
- **Strategy pattern -** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently of the client that use it.
- **Observer pattern -** defines a one-to-many dependencies between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
