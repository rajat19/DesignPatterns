# Head First Design Patterns

## Design principles

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance


## Design patterns
- **Strategy pattern -** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently of the client that use it.
